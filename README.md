Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic process that uses principles used in engineering to develop a high quality software. These principles include designing, building, testing, deploying and maintaining the software. Software engineering plays a huge role in the technology industry for it enables the creation of the software applications which are being used in today's modern life, these industries include;  health, entertainment, communication and commerce. Like most of the well-known softwares and applications used today were all engineered like Facebook;Instagram;Windows;Uber and many more.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s
The early developments of programming languages like (Fortan C)

1970
The arrival of structured programming 

2000s
The rise of Agile Methodologies




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software Development Life Cycle

Requirements:
This is the phase where the gathering and the document of the system requirements user-needs of the software

Design:
This phase includes the crafting of the softwars Architecture and a detailed design of the software and its User-Interface

Implementation: 
In this phase the software code is written to build the software according to its design specifications

Testing: 
Different tests are then run in this phase to ensure the software meets its quality standards and functional requirements.

Deployment:
The period where the software is now released and/or given to customers or the client

Maintenance:
Ongoing support and the updates phase to enhance the software that has been already deployed.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Even though these waterfall and agile are both guides to the software development process they follow very different approaches when it comes to building a software. The Waterfall follows a much linear and  sequential appraoch where one phase must be completed before the other phase can get started, for example building building before a communication app can move to the design phase the requirement phase needs to be completed where the team needs to know and understand what the requirements of the softwares are and also neccessary gathering for these have been done. The agile methodology follows a much flexible aproach which can also be good in responding to change, agile is a focuses on a collaborative were small and repetetive updates are done in the devolopment proces. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Sotware developer is the person responsible for writing the code of the software, they need to ensure that they implement everything required in the software when building is there.

Quality Assurance Engineer 
The role of a QA engineer is to ensure that the software is at its highest quality and also meets the standards, the do this through Designing and executing automated test to test the softwares. 

Project Manager 
The project manager overseas the antire development process, the need to ensure that process of planning executioj and delivery of the software is done on a timely manner and/or within budget. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE- 
Softwares that can write, debug and test the software, without this tool it would be possible to for the software to be devoloped and the software wouldnt be of high quality, a few examples of these softwares are IDLE Jupter Notebook and Pycharm.

VCS
These track the code and also coodinate work amongs team, within a professional work space that is builing a software using agile process it is important for the company to have a software tool that can make teams peform their roles in a none distructive manner using softwares like Git or sbversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change Requirements
When an unplanned requiremnt rises during the development of the software which may lead to a scope creep, which may cause project delays.

Tight Deadlines
Delivering a project and a very short time of space may cause pressure on the developer which may lead to the software not meeting the right quality standards. 

The challenges above can be over come through using agile methodologies, clear communication, continious assessemnt of the project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Different types of testing enot only ensure that the software is of High quality but also its functionality, 
Unit testing individual - component of the software are tested. 

Intergration Testing - how the component interact with each other are test

System Testing - The entire system of the software is tested

Acceptance Testing - This testing types test the software against user needs ensuring if it meets the user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineeringt


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Enginnering is the process of creating question that are clear and specific in order to recieve the relevant and best answers from AI modules.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How many red cars does south africa have.
How many Red cars where manufactured in south africa in the year 2024
